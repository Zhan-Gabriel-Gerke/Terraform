# Terraform Learning Sandbox 🛠️

This repository acts as my personal playground for learning **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles using **Terraform**. 

Here I experiment with provisioning cloud resources, managing state, and understanding the Terraform lifecycle (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`).

### 🚀 Goals
- Hands-on practice with HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).
- Automating infrastructure provisioning (AWS).
- Understanding Terraform modules and resources.
